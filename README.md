# Gel Blaster Warfare
Gel Blaster wars are fun, exciting, and enjoyable for the whole family! Played with [Gel Blaster Warfare](https://tacticaledge.com.au/collections/gel-blaster-rifles) markers that blast Gellets - small, colorful hydrating balls made out of super absorbent polymer. These Gellets are all natural, non-toxic, non-irritating, starch-based material.
